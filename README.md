 # ICS344 Project - SSH Attack, Detection, and Defense
 
 ## Overview
 This project documents the steps taken to simulate, monitor, and defend against an SSH-based cyber attack within a controlled environment.
 
 The project consists of three main phases:
 
 - **Phase 1: Offensive Attack**
 - **Phase 2: Log Monitoring and Visualization**
 - **Phase 3: Defensive Mechanism**

 ## Phase 1: Offensive Attack
 
 ### Objectives:
 - Gain unauthorized access to the target system.
 - Maintain access through a reverse shell.
 
 ### Summary:
 - We scanned the target to identify open ports and services.
 - An SSH brute-force attack was launched using common credentials.
 - After successful access, a reverse shell was initiated to simulate remote control of the machine.

 ## Phase 2: Log Monitoring and Visualization
 
 ### Objectives:
 - Monitor and analyze logs of the attack.
 - Visualize key events related to the SSH compromise.
 
 ### Summary:
 - The system logs were integrated into a SIEM dashboard.
 - The dashboard displayed activities such as failed login attempts and reverse shell execution.
 - Visual graphs and bar charts were generated to show attack patterns.

 ## Phase 3: Defensive Strategy
 
 ### Objectives:
 - Prevent the same attack method from succeeding.
 - Show a clear difference between the systemâ€™s vulnerability before and after defense implementation.
 
 ### Summary:
 - SSH access was hardened through configuration changes.
 - The defense mechanism was tested against the previous attack method.
 - The system successfully blocked or terminated unauthorized access.
